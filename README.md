The basic App for setting up reactJS Development Environment
I followed this link: https://www.kirupa.com/react/setting_up_react_environment.htm

Basically the idea of this project was to set up the basic working reactJS project along with the dev environment on my Windows System. 

This project can be used for getting the basic understanding of reactJS setup on Windows System.
